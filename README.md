# React + Vite | Split Bill Project 
Hi Everyone!!

This is my first ReactJs Application called Split N's Bill. Here I have used state Mangement using useState hook.
Approach:
1. Always split your UI into Components before start building the Application
2. Try to build Static Website first, then Think about state.
3. Think from React PErspective, where to use state, how to use it, where the state will get placed
4. Use the concepts of Props Drilling, lifiting up state if components are sibling
